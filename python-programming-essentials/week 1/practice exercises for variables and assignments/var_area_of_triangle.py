# Tests
# Student should uncomment ONLY ONE of the following at a time.

# Test 1 - Select the following lines and use ctrl+shift+k to uncomment.
x_0, y_0 = 0, 0
x_1, y_1 = 3, 4
x_2, y_2 = 1, 1


# Test 2 - Select the following lines and use ctrl+shift+k to uncomment.
#x_0, y_0 = -2, 4
#x_1, y_1 = 1, 6
#x_2, y_2 = 2, 1


# Test 3 - Select the following lines and use ctrl+shift+k to uncomment.
#x_0, y_0 = 10, 0
#x_1, y_1 = 0, 0
#x_2, y_2 = 0, 10

# Triangle area (Heron's) formula
# Student should enter formulas on the next lines.
a = ((x_0 - x_1) ** 2 + (y_0 - y_1) ** 2) ** 0.5
b = ((x_0 - x_2) ** 2 + (y_0 - y_2) ** 2) ** 0.5
c = ((x_2 - x_1) ** 2 + (y_2 - y_1) ** 2) ** 0.5
s = 0.5 * (a + b + c)
area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

# Test 1 output:
#A triangle with vertices (0,0), (3,4), and (1,1) has an area of 0.5.

# Test 2 output:
#A triangle with vertices (-2,4), (1,6), and (2,1) has an area of 8.5.

# Test 3 output:
#A triangle with vertices (10,0), (0,0), and (0,10) has an area of 50.0.
